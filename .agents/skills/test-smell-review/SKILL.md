name: test-smell-review
description: Review pytest/unittest, Jest/Vitest/Mocha, or any other language's tests for false-green smells — tests that pass without protecting anything (empty, assertion-free, tautological, mocking the unit under test, echoing a mock back to itself). Use after writing or editing test files, and when the user asks to review test quality, find weak tests, or check whether tests actually catch bugs.

# Test Smell Review

A test suite that is 100% green is not proof the code is correct — it is only
proof that no test failed. Apply this judgment whenever tests are written,
edited, or explicitly reviewed: **a test is useful only if some incorrect
implementation would make it fail.** If no such implementation exists, the
test is structurally green regardless of whether the code is right.

Adapted from [`falsegreen-skill`](https://github.com/vinicq/falsegreen-skill)
(MIT). The judgment runs in-context: no subprocess, no API key. See
`reference.md` for the full case catalog and the citation chain.

## If you're about to write a test, not just review one

This skill is analysis-only (the upstream's "Mode A"). It deliberately does
not port the upstream's test-authoring mode — that would duplicate this
repo's existing `tdd` skill (red-green-refactor workflow, mocking guidance).
Instead, borrow one discipline from it when writing a test, then self-check
with Steps 1–4 below before calling it done: **derive the expected value from
an independent source — the spec, a docstring, a hand-computed value — never
from running the code once and copying its output.** A test built that way
is a characterization test, and characterization tests can't fail when the
code is wrong; that is exactly what this skill exists to catch.

## Step 0a: detect the language and framework

- **Python:** `import pytest`/`import unittest`/`from unittest.mock import`,
  `@pytest.mark.*`, `@patch`, plain `assert`/`self.assert*`.
- **TypeScript / JavaScript:** `import { describe, it, expect } from ...`
  (`@jest/globals`, `vitest`), `require('chai')`, global `describe()`/`it()`/
  `test()`/`expect()`, mock cues `jest.fn()`/`vi.fn()`/`sinon.stub()`.
  Runner-agnostic across Jest, Vitest, Mocha+Chai, Jasmine, AVA, `node:test`,
  Cypress, Playwright, and Testing Library — `reference.md`'s TS/JS section
  applies to all of them.
- **Any other language (Go, Rust, Java, ...):** no dedicated structural
  catalog exists here (see `reference.md`'s "Applying this to other
  languages" section) — the language-agnostic J1–J6 judgments (Step 3) and
  the semantic cases (Step 2) still apply directly. Do not skip the review
  just because there's no matching table of codes.

## Step 0b: run the deterministic scanner first, if installed

Python's companion scanner is
[`falsegreen`](https://github.com/vinicq/falsegreen); TS/JS's is
[`falsegreen-js`](https://github.com/vinicq/falsegreen-js). If either is
available, run it on the changed test files before applying any judgment
below — it proves the purely structural cases (empty test, no assertion,
tautological assert, swallowed exception, sleep-in-test, and more — the
"structural"-labeled rows in `reference.md`) deterministically, for free,
with no LLM involved:

```bash
# Python — no install needed, matches this house's uv convention
uvx falsegreen tests/test_changed_file.py

# TypeScript / JavaScript — no install needed
npx falsegreen-js tests/test_changed_file.test.ts
```

Everything either scanner flags is already proven by a parser; do not
re-derive those findings by hand, and do not contradict them. Apply the
judgment protocol below to what a parser cannot prove — that is what the
rest of this skill is for. If the scanner is not installed, apply
`reference.md`'s structural catalog by hand instead of skipping it.

If a `[tool.falsegreen]` block exists in `pyproject.toml` (or `.falsegreen.toml`;
check for an equivalent JS-side config too), read its `exclude`/`disable`/
`severity` settings before judging — that project has already declared some
patterns as intentional (a custom assertion helper, a layer override, a code
turned off) for the deterministic scanner. Honor the same exclusions here
rather than re-flagging what the project already decided isn't a smell for
it. Do not invent a second, skill-only config file for this — one config
surface, shared with the scanner.

## Step 1: classify the test's intent

Before judging the expected value, classify the test. Misclassifying here is
the most common cause of a false alarm:

| Class | Meaning | What counts as the oracle |
|---|---|---|
| spec / TDD | the test *is* the spec; code must match it | the test itself |
| characterization | deliberately freezes today's behavior (e.g. during a refactor) | the current output, by design |
| regression | records a specific known bug fix | the bug report |
| behavior | verifies a production rule or contract | the spec, docstring, or types |

A failing spec/TDD test is not a false positive. A labeled characterization
snapshot is not a frozen bug — do not flag case 18 or C14 against one. Ask
the user if the intent isn't stated in the test name, docstring, or a nearby
comment and it materially changes the verdict.

## Step 1b: read the test level — do not guess

Several codes (C6, C9, C14, and the semantic cases) are only judged correctly
if the level is right. Read it from signals, do not assume "everything here
is a unit test." Precedence, strongest signal wins:

1. **A doubled boundary beats an import.** Python: `unittest.mock`/`patch`/
   `monkeypatch`/`pytest-mock`/`responses`/`requests-mock`/`httpretty`/
   `respx`/`moto`/`fakeredis` intercepts the boundary. TS/JS:
   `jest.mock`/`vi.mock`/`jest.fn`/`vi.spyOn`/`sinon`, `msw`, `nock`. Either
   way, the test is unit/component **even if** a real client (`requests`,
   `boto3`, `axios`, SQLAlchemy, Prisma) is imported — the mock *is* the
   boundary.
2. **Else a real boundary makes it integration.** Python: an in-process test
   client (FastAPI `TestClient`, Flask `test_client`, Django `Client`), a real
   ORM session against a real (even ephemeral/containerized) database. TS/JS:
   supertest `request(app)`, Nest `Test.createTestingModule` + supertest, a
   real DB driver/ORM (Prisma, TypeORM, `pg`, `mongoose`) with no double.
   Either way: a real queue/cache/storage client with no double, still
   integration.
3. **Else a browser/mobile driver makes it E2E** (Playwright, Selenium,
   Cypress, WebdriverIO, Appium — same signal set regardless of language).
4. **No signal → unit.** Real, undoubled I/O in a test with no integration
   signal is itself the smell (mystery guest / over-mocking-inverted, J3/J6)
   — not a legitimate integration test that happens to lack a marker.

Why it matters concretely: a bare truthiness check on a response object (C6)
is a weak-check finding at unit level but *is* the real check at
integration/E2E, where the response existing is the point. Getting the level
wrong in either direction produces a wrong verdict, not just a miscategorized
one.

## Step 2: apply the case catalog (see `reference.md`)

`reference.md` in this skill's directory has the full catalog, organized by
language: Python (Family A–E structural codes), TypeScript/JavaScript (its
own structural table), and one shared "Semantic patterns" section that
applies to **every** language, including ones with no dedicated table — load
the section matching what Step 0a detected. Walk it deliberately — do not
rely on memory of "the famous ones" (assertion-free, tautology) and skip the
rest. In particular, always screen for the semantic cases 10/11/12/15/18 and
at least S11/S12/S16/S17 — these are exactly what a static scanner (Step 0b)
cannot catch, and are the actual reason this skill exists on top of it.

## Step 3: apply the six judgments (J1–J6)

For each test, ask these in order and stop at the first one that fails; every
code in `reference.md` maps to one of these:

| # | Question | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| J1 | Does the assertion actually run? | Dead code after `return`, a loop over an empty collection, an exception swallowed before the assert |
| J2 | Is the expected value from an independent source, not the code's own output? | Asserting a mock's `return_value` back at itself (an echo), re-deriving the production formula as the "expected" value |
| J3 | Is the real unit under test — not a mock standing in for it? | Patching the function being tested instead of one of its dependencies |
| J4 | Does the assertion verify enough, and the right thing? | Truthiness-only checks, `len(x) > 0`, a `str()`/`repr()` comparison that checks formatting instead of the value |
| J5 | Is the test coupled to implementation internals rather than behavior? | Asserting on a mock's positional call args by a computed index, testing a private method directly |
| J6 | Does the test pass in isolation, independent of run order? | Shared mutable module-level state, a test that only passes because an earlier test happened to run first |

Flag **HIGH** only when the failed judgment has no plausible legitimate
interpretation. Flag **LOW** when the smell is likely but a legitimate
reading exists. Everything else is **PASS** — say nothing about it.

**Severity is a ceiling, not a floor.** The catalog's listed severity is the
maximum for that code. Step 1's intent classification can only lower it (a
HIGH code on a deliberate characterization/spec test drops to LOW or is
withdrawn) — it never raises a code above its catalog severity.

## Step 4: adversarial check for case 18 (and any other spec-contradiction finding)

Case 18 — "the expected value contradicts the spec" — is the highest-stakes
finding: it means a bug may be frozen as "correct". Before reporting it:

1. Cite the independent oracle by name (docstring line, type annotation,
   explicit spec section, domain rule). If you cannot cite one, do not
   report it — that's a call for a human, not something to assert from
   pattern-matching alone.
2. Argue the opposite side: assume the expected value is correct, and try to
   defend it. If a plausible defense holds, withdraw the finding or downgrade
   to LOW.
3. Report HIGH only when the cited oracle clearly contradicts the value and
   the adversarial argument doesn't hold.

## Precision rules (do not over-flag)

- Boolean predicates (`isinstance(...)`, `.exists()`, `.is_dir()`) are real
  assertions, not weak truthiness checks (not C6).
- A fluent/library matcher (`hamcrest.assert_that`, assertpy, `numpy.testing.*`,
  `pandas.testing.*`) is the real check even with no bare `assert` keyword —
  absence of the keyword is not absence of verification (not C2/C2b; full
  exemption list in `reference.md`).
- A mock replacing a genuine external edge (DB, network, clock) is never
  case 10/S12; those apply only when the mock replaces the unit being tested.
- `@given`/`@hypothesis`-decorated tests with no explicit `assert` are not
  C2 — the framework generates and checks its own assertions.
- **Tie-break:** when more than one code could fire on the same
  `pytest.raises(...)` (e.g. C9 broad-type, C28 unread binding, S17
  exception-path blindness), report only the most specific one — a broad
  `pytest.raises(Exception)` followed by an assertion on the bound message
  satisfies all three at once; don't stack findings for one root cause.

## Step 5: report

For each real finding, give: the file and line, the code + judgment that
failed, confidence, a one-line reason, and a concrete fix — an independent
expected value or a narrower assertion, not just "add more asserts":

```
tests/test_discount.py:14  [C11 / J2] HIGH
  Asserts mock_rate.return_value back at itself — passes for any return
  value, including a wrong one.
  Fix: assert the real computed result, e.g. `assert result == 90` (10% off
  100, from the spec), not `assert result == mock_rate.return_value`.
```

Then a one-line summary: `Tests reviewed: N. Findings: M (H high, L low).`

If 3 or more findings share the same code, add one closing line suggesting
the user note it as a project convention if the pattern is actually
intentional there — don't repeat the note for every occurrence.
